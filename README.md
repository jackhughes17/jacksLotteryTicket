Allo dere.
This application allows you to spot value bets and possible matched bet scenarios, currently only for h2hs but in a range of sports. It utilises and odds api that can be found online. They offer 500 free requests a month per account(I have mulitple hehe). When you run it, in the command line write 'node main.js > output.json', to output the file with all the bets. 

I skip inplay bets since it is so difficult but there is some chance with maybe inplay tennis, possibly boxing although the markets are so small and infrequent.

Right now you decide which sports and what whether you want value bets or matched bets by just commenting them out(eeeek).
